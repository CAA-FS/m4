;Entity definitions for the player and a stable of monster archetypes.

;We will use these as templates and vary them accordingly.
;Rather than defining classes and using OOP style inheritance, encapsulation, 
;blah....the defentity macro simply provides a convenient way for building 
;functions that package components together in a high-level fashion.  At the 
;end of the day, all of the "entities" we define are really just a collection 
;of the components defined above, with the ability to extend the definitions 
;trivially via inline component definitions, inline or anonymous entity specs,
