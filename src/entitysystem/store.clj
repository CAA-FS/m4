"A component-based architecture is a collection of Domains, Systems, Components,
and entities.  

The central idea behind the architecture is to find a way to decompose the 
traditional hierarchical, intermixed data and functionality present in many 
object-oriented designs along orthogonal, domain-specific lines.  
In the existing simulation framework for Marathon, entities are instances of 
unitdata or demanddata classes.  They have a significant amount of 
functionality associated with (and stuck IN) the class.  There is a sense of 
modularity in the sense that unit policy, behavior, etc. are also objects with 
independent functions.  However, the design suffers from extensibility due to
the encapsulation of domain-specific data and functionality, particularly where 
more than one domain may be accessed.   We have to define the relation between 
unitdata and policy explicitly in the unitdata class…indiciating that all 
unitdata objects (and hence unit entities) must have a policy.  We also see 
data duplication due to encapsulation inside of classes.  Encapsulation also 
limits the visibility of state data (by design) unless everything is made 
public.  No longer can we push around collections of primitive data, we must 
access public members of a class instance (even if we just need a simple 
container for the class data).  As a result, our notion of classes will become 
harder to maintain and extend over time….even with less-primitive OOP 
facilities than in VBA, developing a deep inheritance hierarchy in an OOP 
system inexorably leads to an inflexible and unwieldy design.

A domain is an orthogonal aspect of the simulated environment upon which 
reality is partitioned and modeled.  To describe a component-based architecture, 
we probably need to know what components are.   We’ll do a bit of mutual 
recursion, and rely on another definition to give insight into what a component 
is.  Components are derived from Domains….so what’s a Domain? Domains are the 
orthogonal aspects of a simulated environment upon which the environment is 
partitioned and modeled.   In other words, domains represent clear boundaries 
between functionality, and enable us to abstract a complicated, tangled 
environment into a set of unique domains with clearly defined operations for
each domain, and across said domains.  Domains represent our understanding of
the unique properties of the environment. 

A component is a collection of functionally-similar, or domain-specific data 
(traditionally not functions or methods!)  Strictly speaking, components are 
domain-specific data.   Components derive their meaning from domains because 
they represent an implicit encoding of domain-specific information.  We can 
infer from the set of components, which domains are covered by the environment, 
without having to explicitly state the domains.  This allows for a grass-roots 
approach to design, in which domains are defined in small pieces, and composed.  
The smaller and more specific the component, the more obvious the domain 
context, and the easier it is to factor out duplicate functionality into truly 
unique data (which reinforces our desire to maintain orthogonal domains)."

(defprotocol IEntityStore
  "The entitystore is an abstract protocol for defining functionality necessary 
   to manage entities, as defined by collections of component data.  Due to the 
   independent nature of component data (each component maps 1:1 to a specific, 
   orthogonal domain of information, and is self contained), our entity store 
   could be implemented a number of ways.  The obvious implementation is as a 
   single hash-map database on a single machine.  However, we could easily 
   distribute the component maps across multiple nodes, effectively distributing
   our store and allowing for parallel querying/updating functions.  Finally, 
   we could implement the entitystore using a persistent database backend, if it
   makes sense to do that. "

;in peter's work, and in a real db, from tells us which tables to join.
;where applies a predicate to each row in the joined table, indicating if
;the record should be excluded. 
;order-by indicates how to order of the final resulting recordset.

;the entitystore is a simplified datastore.  We can use relational semantics 
;for selection, projection, etc, since we have primary keys in every table. 
;The simplification is that each table is really just a 2-column recordset, 
;where the first field is always the entity's id, or the primary key. 
;The second field can be any kind of data (likely nested, possibly atomic).
;The simplified records are represented as a key-value pair. 
;So the entity store is a simple key-value store.

   Component parameterization is not mutually recursive, thus there is currently
