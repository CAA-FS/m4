;This is a simple set of utilities for defining post processors for data files.
;The need originated in Marathon scripting...and resulted in a more general 
;library.  Enter the generic processor.

;Processors will typically operate on files, and utilize a set of common data to 
;provide a consistent set of output files with canonical fields.

;Processors must define dependencies, as well as resources they produce...not 
;unlike a build tool.

(ns util.processor
  (:require [clojure [set :as set]]
            [util [io :as io]]))

;A processor is a named task that requires preconditions to hold, and provides 
;a set of post conditions, or effects.  A typical precondition would be the 
;existence of a resource..say a file or an in-memory map or something.

(defprotocol IProcessor 
  (can-process? [p state]
     "Determine if the processor can be run in the given state.")
  (process [p state] "Apply the processor to the process state")
  (process-name [p] "Get the name of the process"))

;The processfunc is a function (ProcessState->ProcessState), where ProcessState
;is a simple map of resource names to resources.  The idea is that we define
;individual sub processes, along with their preconditions (resources required
;prior to running), and their postconditions (resources provided as a result of
;running), then apply the processfunc.

;This will probably be adapted further, currently not used.  The idea is to 
;define inputs for processes, as well as outputs, to allow for a GPS-type
