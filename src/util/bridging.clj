;Tom Spoon 4 July 2012.
;This is a simple library for solving a common problem: bridging data from 
;external sources during import.  In my case, the catalyst was having a team
;member submit data that "sort of" conformed to a shared specification, but 
;not directly.  Specifically, the fields needed for the specification existed, 
;but the names were altered, order was different, and some required fields were
;missing.  I resolved to build a little library to facilitate building quick 
;specifications for data bridges, basically maps that facilitate the re-mapping
;of source data to a new specification. This could be thought of as a special 
;case for SELECT queries in SQL, but a bit more composable.

;Our library of registered bridge maps.  This allows external libs to use 
;defbridge to add new bridge vars, and to store their schema here.  Keeps the 
;data accessible.
(def bridges (atom {})) 

;Philosophically, the point of a bridge is to cross a chasm....in this case, 
;the chasm between some source data and a desired format; we want to rectify
;the problems in the source data to make it palatable (for some other use).

;bridges are composed of elements that relate fields in source data to a new
;field, along with a value to use if the source field does not exist.  At their
;narrowest, bridges simply map only the fields in some source data.  However, 
;as is often the case, we want to also expand the data to add new fields, 
;usually with some default or missing value.  We can accomplish this using 
;SELECT queries to remap the field names, and to add the missing fields.  

;To make it simpler, bridges that define relations for unmatched fields in the 
;source data will add the new fields as necessary, using a default value.
;Fields not addressed by the bridge are dropped by default.
