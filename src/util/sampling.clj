;A generic namespace for drawing samples from populations.
(ns util.sampling
  (:require [util [stats :as stats]]))

;This rose from the "stochastic demand generation" problem that was presented
;in a somewhat convoluted solution in VBA...
;The basic process is this: 
;  We have a population of records P.
;  We want to define functions that sample from the population, according to 
;    ad-hoc constraints, to generate samples of records.  These functions are
;    record-generators, and they typically involve identifying a set of records,
;    the "template" population, and then modifying the template according to 
;    some function.  Modification means mapping a function to the template 
;    population that returns a sampled population (i.e. transforming template
;    or original records into sampled records).  
;  We then want to define a sample as a function of a population and a sequence of
;  or [record-generator, frequency] pairs, that reduces the sequence of one 
;  generator pairs by applying the record-generator to the population, frequency 
;  times, accumulating the resulting sample-records.

;  There is an additional, post-processing phase, where we validate the sample.
;  A valid sample is a set of records in which:
;    A set of dependencies between records from the original population P are 
;    enforced, in that if record A from population P exists in sample S, and
;    record B from population P is dependent upon A, then record B must also 
;    exist in S, where 
;    dependent:: record -> record -> boolean

;    For two records x1, x2, which are members of an equivalence class, denoted
;    by equivalent:: record -> record -> boolean
;    x1 and x2 cannot "intersect", where 
;      intersection:: record -> record -> boolean
;    The "distance" between records identified as members of an equivalance 
;      class  is either 0 or (distance x1 x2) >= (minimum-distance x1 x2) > 0
;      where
;      distance :: record -> record -> float
;      minimum-distance:: record -> record -> float
