;a simulation is a just an event source/repository (the schedule) and 
;event processors. 

;In the vba incarnation of marathon, we created a specific case of the event 
;framework, in that we have a single-threaded, shared event repository (called 
;the event stream), which implements the observer design pattern.  During setup
;subscribers add themselves to events they care about, which means that the 
;centralized eventq will inform them of the passage of an event. 

;Sub processes trigger or raise events during execution, rather than queuing 
;them up explicitly for later execution.  Part of this was to take advantage of 
;ostensbily object-oriented coding facilities...it was hard if not impossible to
;provide dynamic processes in VBA.  As a result, I relegated events to 
;effectively triggering side-effects in a single-threaded context.  

;Much of the operational logic was single-threaded, serialized processing. 
;The "eventful" piece happened to be the daily update functions.  Clients would
;be allowed to request updates at specific times, upon which the manager of time 
;would add unique "eventful days" for updates.  On these days, a serialized 
;process logic would flow over the entire ARFORGEN system...processing only 
;things affected by the update on the day.  So, the net result was a system of 
;supply, demand, policy, executed in a serial fashion upon eventful days.

;Downsides: this required extra book-keeping in the form of an update-manager.
;Despite the illusion of coarse-grained, serialized access to state mangement, 
;much of the event traffic (particularly updates) gets hidden, or has to be 
;explicitly managed....which means more unique event types added to the event 
;vocabulary. 

;There is an arguement for fine-grained event processing....if one can package 
;functions as events, then it becomes quite easy to apply said functions to the 
;active simulation state at a given time.  For logging purposes, we get as much 
;fine-grained event-logging as we want.  We also get extremely fine-grained 
;control (or coarse-grained.....depending on the fn we package) over the 
;changes in simulation state. 

;I want to define a simulation as any process that evolves state as a function 
;of explicit events.  It essentially threads a core notion of state...the 
;simulation state, through a sequence of explicit processes (state transfer 
;functions) that evaluate the next state in the process, culminating in some 
;termination, at which point the final state is returned. 

;The simulation defines an ordering of these processes, and threads state 
;through them.  

;Note -> component functions or processes are packaged as "events" which are 
;sequenced according to some absolute notion of order (generally an absolute 
;notion of time).  

;The simulation is simply a generating function that unfolds a sequence of 
;of state.  Events are evaluated by applying their encapsulated fn to the 
;existing state, and combining the result with the existing state to generate 
;the next state.

;Several things may happen as the result of an event process.  One : state can 
;change.  In fact, the only time state can change is when an event happens, so 
;we have an explicit, fine-grained notion of the simulation history built-in.
;Another possibility is that future changes are required to complete the 
;processing.  These take the form of pending events.  Pending events are 
;typically conjoined to the underlying event sequencing mechanism.  

;Typical execution of the simulation continues until no events remain, or until 
;a predicate condition is reached. 

;Note, if we define a protocol for the sim, we can either do immutable or 
;mutable simulations....just implement the protocol appropriately.
