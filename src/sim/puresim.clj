;This is a scratch namespace for plotting ideas on how to incorporate functional
;reactive programming into a simulation, specifically a discrete event sim.
;Note....we want to separate the presentation from the model...specifically, 
;the aim is to use functional programming (not necessarily reactive programming)
;to compose a model of a simulation elegantly.  We define sets of reactive 
;behaviors....and compose these behaviors to form a (generally time-based) 
;simulation.
