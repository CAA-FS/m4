;Tom Spoon Feb 13 2012.
;This is a library that aims to port the (IMO) nice events-as-data 
;infrastructure from F# into Clojure.  I have most of the core library 
;implemented, as well as a few extra convenience methods.

;The basic abstraction is that observations are just a sequence of events, 
;likely driven by IO.  We model observations with observables and observers:

;Observables serve as the notification mechanism for registering interested 
;parties (observers) and notifying them of new observations.

;Observerers serve as function appliers (usually in the form of side-effects, 
;but not always!).

;We use protocols to define observables and observers, both of which can be 
;easily extended to new data types or existing data.  This is particularly 
;useful for making "noisy" data, where we want to sync up some stateful 
;structure (a model) with a view.

;The primary motivation for this was a bad experience with event management in 
;Java interop.  It's asinine, and effective at hiding the data that's flowing 
;around, i.e. Events.  
;I remembered the nice stuff about F#, and its implementation of the Rx 
;framework, which allows trivial composition of events.  Why not implement it 
;natively in clojure?  The benefit is, we get a composable
;event framework for clojure, and it goes whereever clojure goes.

;Note -> 
;this is a stateful library. Observers can be composed and routed using all of 
;our favorite seq-related functions, like map, filter, etc.  but they are 
;implemented using a ref.  This is fine if we're dealing with IO, specifically 
;nasty GUI stuff (which Java/Swing make even nastier due their interface-madness
;event implementation).

;TBD: error-handling and stopping/disposal of handlers.  There are probably 
;     really nasty corner cases I am missing that will come back to bite.
;     F# does this via auto-detaching observers that fail gracefully.

;I could probably use a nice :eof message or something that's handled by 
;the observable, that propogates the notion that no more observations are 
;coming down the pipe, which would allow observers to disconnect.

;-------------Implementation------------
;The flow of control as exists in an observable/observer pipe is this: 
;  Notifications flow in to the observable, and notify! is called with the 
;  value of the notification. 
;  The observable passes the notification on to each subscribed observer by 
;  calling their update! function on the notification data.
;    --this propogates, since some observers might be dual-hatted as
;      as observables, and cause further propogation throughout the network.

;The observable/observer symbiosm represents an abstract data flow, not unlike
;sequences, where the data is conceptually a stream of events or notifications.
;Combinators are derived by changing the context in which an observer  
;subscribes to an observable......
;Normal subscription implies a relationship in which the observer's update 
;function is called against the notification. 

;To achieve mapping, filtering, etc., we override the observable's notion of 
;subscribe!, and compose special functions to operate on notifications that 
;implement the desired behavior.  The implementation magic is actually inside 
;of subscribe, since it defines a means of combination (or an adapter) through
;which a context may change.

;The primary mechanism in the observable case is to define compositions in terms
;of how new observers are subscribed to the observable.  So when we define a 
;map-obs, we actually define a function that builds an observer that creates
;a new observable, who's mechanism for subscribing observers is to apply a 
;user-supplied function to the input context, then updating subscribers with
;the result of the function.  The result is a conceptual "map" or a "lift" of 
;a function into the stream of notification....
