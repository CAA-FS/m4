(ns sim.impure.observable)

;This is a simple implementation of the oberserver pattern.
;An observer serves as an interface for registering "listeners" that respond to 
;any number of external stimuli by triggering subscribed procedures...
;This is an explicit implementation of native .Net language features.  When we 
;port to .Net or clojure, we "probably" won;t even need this class.

;Basically, the observer keeps an internal list of procedures to call.  We;ll do
;this with object references So, an observer keeps a list of Callables. A 
;callable is just a delegate<;T>, basically it takes an argument and performs 
;some sideffect with it. We will use observers to flexibly automate tasks like 
;logging events, keep track of statistics, recording graphs and trends, etc.

;As a result, the main control flow of the program will populate the event 
;stream, which can be listened to [observed] by any number of registered 
;observers.  The observers will, by convention, perform side effects that 
;DO NOT affect the control flow of the simulation.  They are primarily 
;responsible for recording state, updating the user interface, writing to files, 
;storing statistics for later retrieval. Basically, they accessorize the engine, 
;and provide an easily extendable mechanism to add lots and lots of ad-hoc 
;functionality to the basic simulation without screwing with the dedicated 
;internals of the simulation.

;Note-> we CAN use observers to create side-effects that control the flow of the 
;simulation, but I propose avoiding using them in this manner, to avoid some 
;nasty debugging issues.  The fact that we can use them for this purpose is 
;nice to have around, but it should be done with care and only when necessary.

;Note -> we can also use observers to model functional composition, by passing 
;state references through an observer chain, where each oberver partially 
;mutates the referenced state. While useful, this is again discouraged....
;mutation can inhibit reasoning about the program state, and could create funky 
;bugs that are hard to spot.  Still, if necessary, it could be a powerful tool.

;Note -> there is currently no order of execution in notifying the observers 
;(actually, the order they register is the order of execution.  The net effect
;of this is that observations should be cummutative i.e., the effect of an
;observation should be independent of order of execution. This is another 
;argument against using observers as mutators of state, or signal chains, since 
;the designer would need to be extra vigilant about the order of execution.
;Note -> all of these concerns are moot in F# and clojure.
