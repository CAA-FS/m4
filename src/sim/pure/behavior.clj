(ns sim.pure.behavior)

;in our functional reactive view, we have a set of combinators that replace 
;our propogators of data (observables), and our consumers/transformers of 
;data (observers).

;Specifically, observeables are replaced by behaviors...
;we use sample, or sample-behavior to define a new behavior on a function.
;the new behavior is a function of a behavior context, that feeds the context
;to the function (simple function application), or a simple map.

;in FRP, we don't have an exact analogue for subscribers, or functions that 
;maintain state (although we can!).  We use subscribers to serve as a 
;replacement for function composition in the observer world.  What we 
;really mean to do, is to compute a function result through each composed 
;behavior. 


;There are obvious analogues to FRP....
;In FRP, we have a similar idea of an observable/observer relationship, in which
;some notification is passed into a function network.
;In this case, notification is guaranteed to return a result (it ends up being
;function application of a large, complicated function pipeline to the 
;notification data).

;Like the observer/observable symbiosm, we define means to compose functions 
;that generate functions of notifications->'a.

;The context is very similar, in fact we could use pure semantics, with a 
;similar signature, to define the actions of FRP that look identical to 
;the observable case.

;Rather than notify!, we simply read-value (per the examples below).
;There is no update!, since we're building larger and larger composed functions.

;In FRP, then, subscribers are unnecessary....
