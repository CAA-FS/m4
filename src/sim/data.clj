;;Events are queued in priority order according to time t (some single floating
;;point val).
;;This implemention will be similar to the Agenda from SICP.
;;We have multiple events associated with time, however...
;;I want to use sorted-map to keep this straight.  It has logarithmic
;;performance....
;;Another idea is to have a sorted-map based on float keys (time), whose values
;;are queues.  Could use vectors to add to the queue.
;;Allows for insertion order.
;;Should be pretty fast...
