;Events are descriptions of ways to compute new values from initial values.  
;They are inputs to functions that consume such information to map an 
;initial value, with a description of change, to a new value, with the change 
;implemented (and the pending event removed), or with the change unimplemented 
;(the pending event remains).

;Note -> this is basically a direct copy of the events.base from cljgui
;I'm going to reconcile the two at some point...

;A route is a simple map of event-type to some function that handles 
;event context.

;Every route derives from :default, where the associated routing is just the
