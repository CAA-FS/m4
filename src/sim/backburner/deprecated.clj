;Event handlers are simple.  They look at the next event in the context and 
;compute a response.  This is similar to a parser combinator.  The parser can
;choose to parse a character (parsing one or more characters in the process), 
;or it can return nil/nothing (a failed parse).  In our case, we prefer to 
;return the original context, rather than nothing.  The difference here is that 
;we're possibly consuming events, and Adding events for additional parsing or 
;processing.  Really, all the handler has to do is match the nextevent against 
;some predicate.  If predicate, dispatch on (nextevent events) to determine the
;next context.
